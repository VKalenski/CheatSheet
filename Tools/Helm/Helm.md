### **Helm Theory**

Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes packages called charts. Helm can do the following:

- Create new charts from scratch
- Package charts into chart archive (tgz) files
- Interact with chart repositories where charts are stored
- Install and uninstall charts into an existing Kubernetes cluster
- Manage the release cycle of charts that have been installed with Helm

For Helm, there are three important concepts:

- The chart is a bundle of information necessary to create an instance of a Kubernetes application
- The config contains configuration information that can be merged into a packaged chart to create a releasable object
- A release is a running instance of a chart, combined with a specific config

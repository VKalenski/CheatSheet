What Is Scoop?
Scoop is a command-line installer for Windows. With Scoop, you can install programs and plugins for your terminal. Scoop is a great tool if you're a Linux user who has switched to Windows, as it lets you install programs using the terminal.

Installing programs with Scoops removes the graphical interface and eliminates the permission pop-ups. Scoop automatically finds and installs the dependencies for the program you just installed.

You can also use Scoop to create an installer for your own programs. All in all, Scoop is the Linux user's solace in the graphical environment of Windows.
